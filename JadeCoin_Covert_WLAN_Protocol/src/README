This code was developed several years ago to demonstrate in simulation
the feasibility of performing covert communication in WLANs.  This code
is old and "researchy."  No support is warranted nor shall it be granted.
We might entertain some questions, but be warned the answers you hear may 
not be the ones you expect.  Be forewarned.  Also, all the code is GPL'ed
by the respective authors.  Thanks,

Adam Pridgen
